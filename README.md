# COVID-19_Medical_care_need
Model developed to predict the need of semi-intensive or intensive medical care of patients based on regular blood and urine exams.

In the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, a main issue is to manage the healthcare infra structure in order to serve the infected people. Not every person need semi-intensive or intensive medical care and these medical ressources are scarse due to the ammount of infected people.

In that way this project was created with the target to predict the need of semi-intensive or intensive care of patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, to help the healthcare workers to manage the infrastructure and to improve the possibilities to sava lifes.
